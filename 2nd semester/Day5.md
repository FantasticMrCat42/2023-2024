## Simulations, Part 3 ##
# working with walkers #
the first portion of my time I spent learning about vectors in relation to random walkers. using vectors to store values for both x and y is usfull for organization in cases where a phisics simulation is involved it is nessesary to avoid cluter from to many varables. while I first considerd Vector to be similer to tuples wich can store multiple values I soon realised that it stored the values in an object allowing them to be called with .x or .y
this knolage will be usfull when programing in unity as controling objects uses a very simmiler vector system.

# The only winning move is not to play #
idk what to put here but loved the WarGames reference! 

# Mr wegscheid likes bugs #
mr wegscheid likes bugs so I watched a 8 minite video about bees.
what I learned from this expearience:
I watched a man vacuum a bee
then stick a tracker on the bee
then at the end a cool bit about bees paths to get pollen. I find it intreaging that the bees fly to further scources of nector. the video mentions that this is to avoid competition with other members of there hive, this makes sense but it must mean a majority of the bees go to closer scourses of nector because of the need to conserve energy. it whould otherwise be impractical

# COOL IDEA #
NOTE FOR LATER: we should treat the CSHS not only as a national honor society to organize the 2 other clubs but also lean into the requirment to make a project. the bylaws requires us to make a project and present it. instead I belave we should work in groups on intresting resarch of projects related to computer science then write a scientific paper. thus we can present it at (or at least one group member) GCER as an actual scientific paper. idk i think it whould be cool to be like stanford and NTU.

I am personaly biased because of my interest in AI because the feild is not fully explored. here are some cool stuff from universitys:

# DAY 2 #
most of today we spent working on getting a proper poster for CSHS. while this may seem like a problem of minimal attention I beleave It will define the honor societys branding. whatever color sceam and style we use we will want to stay consistent to not confuse people interested in the honor society.

Zombie dessise model
this is an algorithm describing the spread of a desease. the mathimatical model defines 3 groups including Suseptable, infected and removed.

after playing with the defined variables in the simulaition I found that if you increase the infection distance or probability the increase in rate of infection increases exponentialy while if you decrease the recovery time often the infection will die out befor taking hold.

mr code train talks about how to create vectors that are random. his solution is to create a ranomized direction the adjust the magnitude instead of multipying each indiviual value in the vector
