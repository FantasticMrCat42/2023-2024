# AI, Part 1: Overview & History # 
the first video mainly covers how AI might replace jobs in the future. I can 100% see many jobs get taken by AI in the coming years and one that I am interested in is the job of software enginer as it will be on of the main jobs people in the comp sci space will look too. on the note of AI replacing people a new framework/project came out called Devin. Its one of the newer attempts that gives an AI agen accses to the internet, a terminal, and a code IDE as well as an LLM to comunicate to the user. by no means does it do a good job, only solving about 13% of problems from the dataset if I remember corectly but it shows an interesting treand in the future of AI software development.

the next video goes more in depth on what specific ocupations will most likely be taken by AI. the main point is that jobs that require phisical labor were more likely to be ottomated by other methods that are not the modern generative or recognition models. this is true and even with new AI projects such as the ALOHA model from stanford:

another more recent example that promesses more but is from a for profit company (so take literaly evry thing with a grain of salt).

this one appears supper impressive but i am still sceptical of its proformance.
