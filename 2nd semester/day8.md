# The geometry of Chaos #
Fractals main atrabute is that they have infiniate detail as you zoom into the fractal. I think the sierpinski triangle is a good example as it is easy to replicate in code and the infinate detail is obviuse when following the steps of the algorith
SUDO CODE
//a randomizer that choses a number from 1 and 3 \
//this is stored in a variable oldNum\
//a loop for the iterations specifide\
  //a randomizer that choses a number from 1 and 3\
  //this is stored in a variable newNum\
  // (newNum + oldNum)/2 = drawnDot\
  //draws dot\
  //stors drawn dot as oldNum\
## the papers and videos ##
the scientific paper on fractals included several paterns that appeard to be similer the the gausian noise distrobutions that we worked on in previus weeks

  The next two videos looked at jackson Polluck and how fractles are part of nature including treas and lighting.
  the most interesting thing about these videos is how they discust the neralogical aspect of fractals and how jackson pollocks paintings increasingly took on more and more fractal designs. they mention that people are predesposed to be atracted to fractals using a experement at asumadly a local high school.
