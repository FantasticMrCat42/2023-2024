# The geometry of Chaos #
Fractals main atrabute is that they have infiniate detail as you zoom into the fractal. I think the sierpinski triangle is a good example as it is easy to replicate in code and the infinate detail is obviuse when following the steps of the algorith
SUDO CODE
//a randomizer that choses a number from 1 and 3 \
//this is stored in a variable oldNum\
//a loop for the iterations specifide\
  //a randomizer that choses a number from 1 and 3\
  //this is stored in a variable newNum\
  // (newNum + oldNum)/2 = drawnDot\
  //draws dot\
  //stors drawn dot as oldNum\
## the papers and videos ##
the scientific paper on fractals included several paterns that appeard to be similer the the gausian noise distrobutions that we worked on in previus weeks

  The next two videos looked at jackson Polluck and how fractles are part of nature including treas and lighting.
  the most interesting thing about these videos is how they discust the neralogical aspect of fractals and how jackson pollocks paintings increasingly took on more and more fractal designs. they mention that people are predesposed to be atracted to fractals using a experement at asumadly a local high school.

## Pushing and poping arrays ##
pushMatrix(); remembers the curent state

popMatrix(); will take you back to the previose state before transformations
both control a stack like an array that stores info. LIFO = last in , first out. LIFO
stack underflow and overflow is when you run out of stack space if you have to many of the push or pop maticies
the example video shows that to translate the position of one item and not all items in the draw function without using mutiple translate lines. instead you can use push and pop matixis.
basicly stores the transformations made so you dont need to figure out how to reverse stuff.

## Fractals in Africa ##
the video covers how the archatecture in africa shows fractal paterns. my favorite from this video was the ba-ila vilage fractal.

often times the fractals that were found were not specificly intended but instead were just the intuative way to people. in some cases the fractals were intended or at least the underling algorithm was based in fact. an example of this is the scalinmg windscreen as they were optimised to scale with the wind speed. the random number generation was cool to in the sand drawings
