# Simulations, Part 4: The Grab Bag #
## Exploring pandemic simulations ##
the video discuses how simulations can be used to model senarios that could not be tested on a sample population. The videos discusion on the reaction to an outbreak realy is similer to the responce we to during the pandemic. the video mentions social distancing and modeling the effects of closing schools and it proves how truly indespencable models are for problem solving. one point on simulations is how we use the same term _models_ to mean a mathamaticl algorithm in the case of a simulation and in the context of Machine learning or AI models that are populare in todays tech environment. this makes sense because they are both fundementaly the same thing.

## Disease Modeling & Covid ##
the blue one brown video: the model splits people into the three catagories suseptable, infectus and recoverd/removed(dead). I liked the quantitive mesure of how much the desese can spreaad using R paired with R-not. this is reminicent of my statistics class and tracks closly in many ways. the main prediction that suprised me was the idea of a second and third wave as society opens up then has to reimpliment mesures as another outbrack ocures. this was a major issue and part of the reason that the pandemic lasted so long.

zombie videos
this video discused how virusses adapt as they transmit between hosts. I was suprised that in the simulations speed was more optimised for instead of agression especial considering the energy cost. in the folowing videos on zombies simulations and study for educaiton perposes it is used mainly to get attention to teach other deeper topics.


Videos on simulations
this video points out that models do not just have to be mathimatical but can also be phisical or just be a model of steps like a to do list. another important point was that simulations can include 3d modeling products to test for vunrabilitys or a driving simulation. the main perpose is to anilize without risk and at a lower cost.
this is a video by tom scott covering a tank simulation from the 1970s using a diorama and a controlable camera. i found it interesting and it relates to using simulations in a non virtual enviroment even befor computers with 3d graphics

missisipi model + rivers:
this was a phisical model used by the government for flood responce and modeling responce infistructure. this model was masive and still saved the government monney because it made there responces planed and more effective.
the second video covers using models for seeang how sedement is distributed.

The von noiman probe and the game of life:
I am familer witht the game of life and have played around with the simulation in the past but watching the numberphile video brought up the life of mr von noighman who I am also aware of from scifi novels. specificly 
a searies called the bobiverse books a truely remarkable set of books with great adaptations on audable. the book follows the life of a man who dies and is criogenicly frozon and is later converted to an AI form of his intelegence. the book follows his jounry as a von nouman probe exploring the galaxy looking for habitable places for the dieing remenets of humanity to live. This book series is wonderfull and I segust it to evryone.

the game of life follows a simple algorithmic set of rules allowing for some impressively complex simulaitons
an example I remember was the game of life is life. this is the orginal video
