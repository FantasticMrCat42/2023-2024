# Simulations, Part 4: The Grab Bag #
## Exploring pandemic simulations ##
the video discuses how simulations can be used to model senarios that could not be tested on a sample population. The videos discusion on the reaction to an outbreak realy is similer to the responce we to during the pandemic. the video mentions social distancing and modeling the effects of closing schools and it proves how truly indespencable models are for problem solving. one point on simulations is how we use the same term _models_ to mean a mathamaticl algorithm in the case of a simulation and in the context of Machine learning or AI models that are populare in todays tech environment. this makes sense because they are both fundementaly the same thing.
