## TASK, part 1 ##
My portfolio is mainly going to be to showcase my work to either employers or a University. I am going to focus more on creating a portfolio targeted to geting a job though because I feel I can have more freedom with formating also I will make a seperate portfolio focusing more on what a collage may be looking for.

## TASK, part 2 ##
I could design my portfolio to explain my thought prosses and how I work through problems along with a timeline of my work at key points. This will convey to potential employers how I could fit into there work environment. I also want to include personal projects that I have a conneciton to such as my AI-VA project (idk. its my AI visual assistant for the blind but i need a name so I made it an acranim. also i can call the assistant Iva).
