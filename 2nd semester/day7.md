## New life games
the first video covers new games that follow the simulation of life format. the first is life engine which is similer to conways game of life but includes alot more complex mechanics represented as pixels including eyes and energy consumtion. lenia is a program that is much more complex with many speacies. this is folowed by walking simulators using evolution models to learn to walk or swim. the most interesting simulations were the ones that generate soft bodys from cells then evolves the best apendeges and shape to move.

the next video is on simultions of citys. I mainly zoned out with this one  cuz its 2:25 in the morning but it did remind me of the game rolicoster tycoon coded by the indi game developer cris sawyer who coded the game in friken asembaly. the game was a very impresive simulation with each character having preference on what rides they liked which influenced there trip in the park.

## Ants
i watched a game about ants for 2 resouns one: because it was a very cool simulation. 2 because mr wegscheid likes bugs as stated in the quote "bugs aree prety cool"

## travaling salsman problem
this problem has always been a well known mathamatical problem with the issue of computation time as a botleneck. the issue is that to find the true best path you need to basicly try evrything wich as you add more nodes grows computation time exponentualy. this video mentions the heuristic algorithms but does not explain how they work so i will probaly look at it later because I want to know what solution they have.


## more Ants
theres a video on ants but its 2:45 so im out.
alr im back after watching the video (not sure why I am treating this github repo like a person I am taliking to but im going instain its 3:24 in the morning)
so the video mainly talks about finding optimal paths through pheramones. the paterns reminds me of somthing called gradient descent from my resarch of machine learning.
[vid](https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w?si=5D3EY2tSmVZPRHQy)

then i got sidetracked watching a fluid simulation of bad apple
then i got sidetracked learning about the song and video
then i thought about how the video uses flat colors but the brain infers depth based on the movement becasue when on one frame it looks flat 
then i got side tracked on a n old video I watched about persistance of vison used this way [weird pov effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdTMeNXCnTs)
then i got side tracked because persistance of vision is the techneqe used by CRT TVs. because there is only one point of light runing across the screen in scan lines but because of the speed of motion our brains interprate it as the full image
thin i got side tracked watching the technology connections youtube chanal on old tech because he made the crt video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4UgZBs7ZGo]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4UgZBs7ZGo))
then i watched a video on how cassets store data in magnetic tape and then real to real tape recorders.
it is now 3:40 in the morning and all i proved is that I get sidetracked easily and that when given a text doc i will ultamatly manafest it as my internal monolage.

## mr wegscheid likes bugs, I hate java.
this portion is basicly me explaining an idea for a game I had and want to explore more now that we reached this unit. also i like python and am sad that I have to learn java. while new programing languages are very similler just with diferent sintax, swaping to java feels like somone rearanged where you put evrything in you room and now making projects is hard because you have to search for evrything. 

Zen-Jar
the idea is the player gets to design very specific plants with flowers and leaves of there chosing. all leaves and plants have there own functionality and requirments. the player can even design specific parts of the plant like the leaves by adjusting size shape and surface area, color ,ect. the olayer whuold then need to keep the plants alive in a real time simulation of a tararium in a jar with the diferent plants they designed. so gameplay loop goes thus: make plants, adjust terarium environment (cost money to maintain things like higher light levels), make more plants, step 3: profit (idk how they get money, maybe by selling there terariums or specific plants, or items from the plants), then the palyer can buy or upgrade more terarums.

this is all a far out of the scope of my coding skills in any language but in the time we have in class I hope I can learn enugh java to do some back end calculations based on a plant the player adjust the variabls of.
so basicly a text version of the simulation with changing environment and maybe a cost system. 
the game takes insperation from games such as:
pvz zen garden

i like the art style and feel of monument vally (but more of a paper feal):

manifold garden (cool art style with outlines) also a cool game its makes me think of fractals
