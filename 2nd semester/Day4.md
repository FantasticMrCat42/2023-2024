## TRON ##
we learned about noise and its origonal use of noise in the movie tron for proceadreal texture generation. perlin noise is different from random noise bacause it provides a smooth noise graph that is still random. perlin noise is generated through a clever algorithm that uses random points connected using interprolation. 

this was a python program I made last year in prossesing. it utilized perlin noise for the terain generation

## PIVOT TO WIFI LEARNING ##
- it starts with a prompt -
to start my resaerch in new topics I find that chatbots and llms answer my partiqular quastions providing me with a good starting point for reserch talored to my situation. the following was my prompt

Prompt:
I am in a building which is old and has no access to mobile data. I need a way to get internet in this building that can provide wifi. give me an in depth solution tailored to someone who has an intermediate knowledge of the topic

Solution:

The easiest solution is to use a cellular modem/router combo device. These are portable hotspots that use cellular data networks like 4G LTE to connect to the internet. Simply turn on the device in your building and connect your Wi-Fi devices. The main downsides are monthly data caps and slower speeds compared to wired internet.

my solution:
use a cleen install of crome using a new account that avoids restrictions


## DAY 5 ##
**Experimentation**

I used the video on noise to create the code. I experimented with changing the color of the the line to adjust as it increases and decreases. unfortunatly the entire line changed color because it is considerd a single shape.

while i did not get much done with coding I did spend quite a bit of time learning how to use Java. I set up prossing and tryed to understand the syntax. the language is most simmiler to C from my experiance of different programing languages. this makes me intrested in understanding the differnent languages.
