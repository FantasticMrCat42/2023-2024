## Microsoft Paint & other painting programs ##
we learned about the history of painting programs on the computer including ms paint but the paint program on mac was not included because we covered it earlyer. 

interestingly the paint program packaged with windows today includes new featers as Microsoft focus on incorporating AI into literaly any product posible. the new additions include the ability to add layers as well as an AI image genoratlor that asumidly utilizes the bing AI image genorator, wich I am pretty sure is just open AI's Dall-e image creator. moral of the story is that microsoft mainly just pays for other peoples products and repacages them.

A Drawing App, v. 1
an issue I ran into while creating the app was its inability to paint dots because it required a change in position. i plan on fixing this in a later iteration
