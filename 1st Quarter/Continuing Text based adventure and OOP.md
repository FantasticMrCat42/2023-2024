# fear and loathing on the oregon trail
first I explored several old text based adventure games including organ trail and zork. both games I have played in the past but I revisited them for insperation on my own text based adenture game coding project. I hope I can include some of the feateres includining the optional diologe in oregon trail or the multiple responce input system using numbers.

here is a document of my experences:
we set out with no food, water, or suplies. all we had was 18 oxen and a $1,600 in cash.
