## Tkinter:Choice Task ##

my 4 Tkinter totorials / Resourses
this is most likely the most usfull resourse when learning new python librarys. The abitlity to bug fix with the assistance of AI enables faster learning and the explinations of any of the librarys functions means its easyer to find the corect solutions.

my next resourse is a youtube video on tkinter. I found a usfull playlist / course covering basicly evrything in tkinter. this is great if you need a specific  portion of tkinter explained or you want to know as much as posible but its 225 videos.

another resource if found was a totorial on how to make check boxes. I plan on using this when I work on my final project wihc is an AI image genorator. I want to use checkboxes as part of the UI.

my final source is a video on how to make tabs in tkinter. I beleave this will be usfull when creating my project. I want to have several tabs for difrent workspaces in the UI for diferent functions like img2img and txt2img or txt2vid
