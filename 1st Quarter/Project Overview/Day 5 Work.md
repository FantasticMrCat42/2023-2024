today i finnshed most of the inputs and slimed down the GUI to provide the Minimum viable product in a fully working compasity
the New GUI:
<img width="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/FantasticMrCat42/2023-2024/assets/129550102/20168686-aa95-44e5-ae48-c0c74c632310">
I still have the issue with a image being genorated when starting the program but I am still unsure why.
I also experimented with some settings and found a visual issue with the CFG Value wich is unlike that of other GUIs
in this case it apears to ether flaten the colors and make them appere more vibrent unlike that of A1111 where the image looks like its formed into noise shards or get a shean of opelecent colors.
i utilised this and created the folloing images of a 1926 black bentley.
