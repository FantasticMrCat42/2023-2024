# My project #
I decided for my project that I will contunue to work on a simple personal project I had experimented with. I plan on creating a simple and easy to use Image genoration GUI that uses some of the newest Stable difusion Models and techniques. For todays work I need to come up with 5 potential Ideas for the project so here are some more ideas that I could have worked on.

## ___5 Ideas___ ##
- create a working simle GUI using tkinter for stable difusion image genoration
- create a simple task assistant using tkinter that incorporates an LLM (an LLM is a Larg Language Model. an example of one whould be [chatGPT](https://openai.com) from openAI or [claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude) from anthropic)
- a simple text adventure game with very litle in actual adventure but it includes interacting NPCs all with indipented AIs so they can convers with eachother within the simulation. in this case the player is just kinda vibin in the game and watching what the AIs do. this simulation has been created before by reaserchers as seen [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf). the tex adventure/ exploring the town of NPCs is using OOP
- an AI audiobook genorator using tkinter as a GUI. I like some audio book Nararators more than others and in the case of a specific book I had a problem. the book is called "How we got to now" and features a history of diferent inventions that lead humanity to where it is today. there was a coresponding documentery on PBS with the author presenting it and I absolutly loved it. the issue is the book is not read by the author. solution: I used RVC to convert the audible naration into a specific voice model I trained on his voice.

I compiled sevrel hours of recordings from social media and youtube interviews to create the model. an bit of the original show is [here](https://youtu.be/x8OdvHe-fRg?t=7). but the voice i emulated was similer to him in interviews. here is a clip of his actual voice from an interview: [link to file](https://github.com/FantasticMrCat42/2023-2024/blob/main/1st%20Quarter/Project%20Overview/Steven_Johnson_real_voice.mp3)

and this is my AI cloned Model:

## Notes & Quesitons ##
-  demonstraits who you are
-  soft skills
-  critcal thinking is vital
-  creative thinking is also valued
(all question aswers were longer but due to STUPID swipe gestures on the laptop it activated the back button and deleated all of my progress and curently I am too Pissed to rewrite them because I did a good job the first time and at this point I am just angry that git hub didnt prompt me with an "are you sure" button because I had lake 5 paragraphs answering these so just take it on faith that i wrote more. also yes I am aware that that was a run on sentinse but i am to angry for grammer.)
**How did the video mesh with your thoughts and ideas related to portfolios?**
I think the video iterates the fact that grades and test scores are not the only thing that matters to employers or collages. an important factors include to show who you are. you can do this in a portfolio as well by being creative with you projects. 

**After looking at and thinking about your own portfolio, what sort of changes or additions would you like to make to it?**
over the summer I worked on a portfoliio that I designed in figgma and was working on in webflow but I was unable to finnish it before school started. I whould include more of my projects to the portfolio and provide short descriptions that demonstrate my critical thinking skills and ability to overcome problems

**How can you show experiences that demonstrate soft skills to potential employers and/or universities.**
you could include examples of projects that you worked on in a team. for example my work on my robot for GCER.



**Why should they choose you over other people?**
I am working with AI and that is currently a rapidly developing technology
**A common topic related to college and university is well-rounded vs spike; are you familiar with it? You should probably look into it at least a little so you're familiar with the concept.**
I asume  a well-rounded individual has several developed skills while a spike has a single or close nit set of skills that they are an expert on. in my opinion a well rounded person could be a good coder but a spike will often come up with the revolutionary ideas. 

**What do you want to do when you finish school? Like, specifically, what area do you want to work in/study in? How are you getting prepared for that? How are you showing interest in that?**
I am am focusing on AI and coding to interprate and use AI for tools. I think literaly the rest of my document explains how I am getting prepared and showing intrest.
**When they're looking at your application vs. others, what will they see that will make you standout vs. those you're competing with?**
I have no idea other than that I use AI but if I am compared to others in the feild of machine learning all ive got is I have sevral projects and have been experimenting since 15
**You have a break coming up; could you use some of your break time to work on things related to the direction you want your future to take?**
sure ok
