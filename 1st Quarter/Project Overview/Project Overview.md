# My project #
I decided for my project that I will contunue to work on a simple personal project I had experimented with. I plan on creating a simple and easy to use Image genoration GUI that uses some of the newest Stable difusion Models and techniques. For todays work I need to come up with 5 potential Ideas for the project so here are some more ideas that I could have worked on.

## ___5 Ideas___ ##
- create a working simle GUI using tkinter for stable difusion image genoration
- create a simple task assistant using tkinter that incorporates an LLM (an LLM is a Larg Language Model. an example of one whould be [chatGPT](https://openai.com) from openAI or [claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude) from anthropic)
- a simple text adventure game with very litle in actual adventure but it includes interacting NPCs all with indipented AIs so they can convers with eachother within the simulation. in this case the player is just kinda vibin in the game and watching what the AIs do. this simulation has been created before by reaserchers as seen [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf). the tex adventure/ exploring the town of NPCs is using OOP
- an AI audiobook genorator using tkinter as a GUI. I like some audio book Nararators more than others and in the case of a specific book I had a problem. the book is called "How we got to now" and features a history of diferent inventions that lead humanity to where it is today. there was a coresponding documentery on PBS with the author presenting it and I absolutly loved it. the issue is the book is not read by the author. solution: I used RVC to convert the audible naration into a specific voice model I trained on his voice.

I compiled sevrel hours of recordings from social media and youtube interviews to create the model. an bit of the original show is [here](https://youtu.be/x8OdvHe-fRg?t=7). but the voice i emulated was similer to him in interviews. here is a clip of his actual voice from an interview: [link to file](https://github.com/FantasticMrCat42/2023-2024/blob/main/1st%20Quarter/Project%20Overview/Steven_Johnson_real_voice.mp3)

and this is my AI cloned Model:
