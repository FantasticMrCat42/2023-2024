Today I contunued to work more on my stable diffusion GUI and ran into a couple of obsticles including the fact tha when running the image generation prosses the UI whould freaze as the image was genroated. I plan on fixing this next class with the implimentation of threads from the threading python library. I also spent time coding the UI to resemble my original mock up of the Ui that I made in figma:

this is my working verision using costom tkinter:

the inputs are still not fully intigrated so I will need to make changes to connect the front end to the image pipline. another obstical I am currently facing is the issue of multimple inputs with dials.
