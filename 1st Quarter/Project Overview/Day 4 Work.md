today i worked on multiple tasks. I atempted to create a working verion of the slider and input system that links the values. On this front i failed to get this working and will most likley avoid issues with this by only allowing the input button and disabling the slider.

most of the time i spent fixing my code to display the image in the correct resoultion.
