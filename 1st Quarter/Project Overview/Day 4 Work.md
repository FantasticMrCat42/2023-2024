today i worked on multiple tasks. I atempted to create a working verion of the slider and input system that links the values. On this front i failed to get this working and will most likley avoid issues with this by only allowing the input button and disabling the slider.

most of the time i spent fixing my code to display the image in the correct resoultion.
<img width="748" alt="image" src="https://github.com/FantasticMrCat42/2023-2024/assets/129550102/a35ccfb7-139c-431e-8901-8434f58e28f8">
this is the example image i gernerated

I fixed an issue with an image always genorating when starting the GUI. I still need to hook up the inputs to my RunSDXL function but once that is done i should have a compleat MVP
