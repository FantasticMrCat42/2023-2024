## Day 2 Work ##
today I worked on creating a layout for my user interface. it combines sevral fetures from the webui's i showcased in the last workday. I also limited the about of settings thrught sevral techniqes. first is the img2img tab in most GUIs inludes all of the same settings as text to image so i decided to compress it by incorporating it as a setting you can add by draging a picture in to the uplode box.

this is the current GUI plan mocked up in Figma.
