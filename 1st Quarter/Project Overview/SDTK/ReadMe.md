## Project Write-Up ##
# Summary #
this project focused on creating a intuative but somewhat adavanced user interface for generating images with Stable diffusion. in the end I feal I made valuable progress twords that goal and learned alot I plan on using when I make a second implimentation. the main issues I faced was the diffusers python library by hugginh face. while it was easy and had lots of documentation I still ran into several issues when trying to run the models entirly localy.

to create the GUI I am using the custom Tkinter library instead of the basic Tkinter library. the custom tkinter library is almost the exact same as Tkinter but it inludes a more adjustable UI including dark mode. I started the project by trying to learn the Diffusers library. the main issues I faced with this project was getting mutiple inputs to sync in the GUI. to avoid this issue I just limited the user interface to single inputs and disabled the sliders. i also revisitid the PIL library to display and adjust images to fit the interface. I plan on expanding it further but the code is rushed and should honestly be rewriten.
