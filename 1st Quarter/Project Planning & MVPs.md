## TASK ## 
1) How could your project fit with the 'fingerprint' or focus you want to present in your resume/portfolio?
my project will fit within my focus of Creating AI tools using Tkinter for the GUI. Most of my portfolio peaces relate to the use of AI so creating a stable difusion Image creator would enhanse my overall goal.

**2) What would be your minimum viable product? **
my minimum viable product whould consist of a simple GUI that whould allow the user to genorate images. I at least want my product to be able to swap what Stable difusion model is used and include many of the sedings like setting a seed for the noise value and cfg value (Classifier-Free Guidance Scale). I whould like to also include a live genoration feeture that whould genorate the image as you type similer to a doc auto saving instead of just when you press save. this whould allow the user to better understand how words affect the prompt, also it includes the SDXL Turbo model that came out on the 28th of november (so if i was doing this work on time instead of making an honor society It whould release in the future lol. point is AI moves way to fast). 
**If your project is more ambitious than you expected, what's your contingency plan? **
I can cut it down to just the image genoration portion with very litle other features. but this whould be a very simple user interface.
**If your project is less ambitious than you expected, what are ways you can extend/expand your project?**
I want to inlcude use of control net as well change the backend to not use the diffusers library pipline. unfortunatly I dont know how to becuse there is literaly no informaiton online. I could serch throught the hundreds of scripts in the A1111 webui I run to genorate images because its open source but it whould take alot of time to understand. MAKE IT AN .EXE, i whould realy like to make it an executable file or at least a .bat file so that it whould imidatly run in the terminal instead of having to write python project_file_name.py

3) What are 3 resources that could help you with your project?
definitly this 18 hour course Ive been watching because it explains a ton of diferent apps and how they were coded as well as how to make a nice GUI: [here](https://youtu.be/mop6g-c5HEY?si=n9UJX8jX8_4FFRyB)
second whould probaly be [sdxl turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo) because it came out 3 days ago and cuts genoration time down to real time. it includes some code to get it working
finaly is this issue thread on github I just found to fix the loading local models issue i mentioned in the MVP section. the issue thread is [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/4029)

5) Start working on a project write up for your resume, similar to what I showed you in the video. Include:

a short one-paragraph summary

```
"this is a simple Tkinter based image Stable Difusion GUI for genorating AI images. It uses the newest models for faster loading times and real time updating on prompts. it uses Tkinter to create a simple user interface wich does not run inside of a webroser like evry other UI.  "
```

relevant skills
```
"I used reaserch skils to find the resources such to use the diffuers pipline for image rendering. I also utilised critical thinking to work past bugs. some of wich include an issue with images not outputing in the UI due to them beaing stored as an aray for the stable defusion model to manimplate the image"
```

If working with a partner; include your responsibilities (as opposed to those of your partner/s)
```
"whould love to have a partener but I like the front end GUI desing and no one else could create a good UX because I dont know anyone who actualy uses an image genorator so they whouldnt know the best layout. also the back end genoration whould be problematic as well because the only reason I understand this is becuase i reserached it as a pation project"
```
