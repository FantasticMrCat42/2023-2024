**OOP and Turtles**


# Working with Turtles # 

this week I Worked on learning Object oriented programing as well as how to use the turtle python library. I have used OOP before when working with Unity because basicly evrything in unity uses OOP. I mainly focused on using the turtle library and created a crude depiction of a man with a handle bar mustache as depicted bellow.

I also expored using the .clone method. to create 2 different turtles but I did not have the time to make the turtles move at the same time.
