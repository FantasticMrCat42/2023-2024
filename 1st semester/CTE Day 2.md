# CTE day 2 #

today I worked on to major points in the CTE project. first I adapted my origanal scratch project to work with a single question about the new tacos the district is testing. this proved simple because due to the setup of the code. It was designed so that adding a question is trivial and I was able to compleat this task in under six minutes. the second task for the day proved more dificult as we neded to decorate each of the boxes we were using at the CTE event. to find resources for decorating the boxes me and paisley visited the art teachers for suplies and were able to compile paper that could be used for our designs.

our first design was a pinata as it was colorfull and whould be eye catching meaning people whould be more likely to take the survey. I did not personaly work on this design as this task was delicated to paisley and her group.

for the taco specific question We designed a second box that was taco inspired. our orignal design was to create another pinata to create continuity but it proved too time consuming and was infesable with the amount of time we had. we pivited and made a simple taco that used the box verticaly instead of horizontaly as to maintain a tacos aspect ratio as best as posible.
